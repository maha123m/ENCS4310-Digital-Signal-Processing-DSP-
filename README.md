# ENCS4310-Digital-Signal-Processing-DSP-
## Overview
This project involves two phases. In the first phase, an English alphabet character voice-frequency encoder
is designed and implemented, representing each character through a combination of three voice-band frequency
components (low, middle, and high). A GUI is developed to allow users to input English strings,
generating corresponding signals that can be played or saved as audio files.

The second phase focuses on designing and implementing two decoding systems: one utilizing frequency analysis
and the other employing bandpass filters. A GUI is built to enable users to upload audio files and decode the
sequence of tones into English characters, displaying the result on the screen. The accuracy of both decoding 
systems is tested with various encoded strings of different lengths. The accuracy is measured as the number of 
correctly recognized letters divided by the string length.
